## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
In this project, I will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. I will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, I will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. I will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, you will optimize the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Project Highlights
This project is designed to get me acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things I will learn by completing this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

## Software Requirements

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

## Project Editing

This project contains three files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file where I will be performing my work on the project.
- `census.csv`: The project dataset. I'll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command `jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb` to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can use the command `jupyter notebook` or `ipython notebook` and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the project.
